The only to do great work.
It is just what you love to do.
If you have not yet such a thing yet,
Keep looking.

Do not compromise.

[Gandhi remarks]
Your faith is your thought,
Your thoughts soon become words you say,
What you say is your act,
Your actions soon become your habits,
Your habits soon become your values,
Your values soon become your destiny.
